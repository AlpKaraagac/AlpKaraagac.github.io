## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Alp Karaagac

Iâ€™m a **Turkish computer science student** currently pursuing my **Masterâ€™s in Informatics** at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, where I also completed my Bachelorâ€™s. My academic path has been shaped by a strong interest in the **theoretical underpinnings** of machine learning, deep learning, and more recently, **natural language processing (NLP)**. 

Iâ€™m passionate about understanding how intelligence can be built from the ground up â€” both from a **mathematical** and a **practical** perspective. My studies and side projects often explore that space where clean theory meets real-world application.

## ðŸ’¡ What Drives Me

Iâ€™m deeply motivated by the challenge of making things more efficient â€” whether thatâ€™s a system, a workflow, or even myself. Just like the tools I build, Iâ€™m constantly looking for ways to **optimize my routines, refine my thinking**, and pursue goals more effectively. 

I care about **success**, not as a destination, but as a process of **continuous iteration and improvement**. Thatâ€™s what fuels my work in automation and applied AI â€” building solutions that simplify the mundane, reduce friction, and allow for more focus on what truly matters.

## ðŸ§  Projects & Research

Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of research and engineering projects with a focus on automation, finance, and optimization. Some of the highlights include:

- **Bachelorâ€™s Thesis**: *Learning to Optimize* â€” a deep dive into using machine learning to enhance optimization strategies through theoretical modeling.
- **Smart Heat Pump Control**: Collaborated on a real-world energy systems project applying predictive control to optimize heating in residential settings.
- **Reinforcement Learning Trading Bot**: Built a prototype RL agent for financial trading using market simulation environments and reward shaping.
- **NLP for Financial News**: Developed a pipeline for extracting and analyzing sentiment and trends from financial headlines and articles, enabling better decision support in finance-focused workflows.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Skills

- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn  
- **Concepts**: OOP, Machine Learning Theory, NLP, Reinforcement Learning  
- **Tools**: Jupyter, Git, LaTeX, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Workflow**: Research, Experimentation, Prototyping, Iteration

## ðŸŽ¹ Outside Work

When Iâ€™m not coding or studying, I spend time on activities that challenge me in different ways. Iâ€™ve been playing the **piano** for years and enjoy exploring both classical and improvisational styles. Iâ€™m also into **bouldering** and practice **karate** â€” both of which keep me active, focused, and grounded.
