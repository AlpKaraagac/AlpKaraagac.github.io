Welcome 👋

I'm **Alp Karaagac**, a Master's student in Computer Science at **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**, where I also completed my Bachelor's. I’m passionate about the intersection of **machine learning, deep learning, and NLP**, with a strong appreciation for theory and mathematical foundations.

I'm especially driven by finding ways to **automate and optimize everyday tasks**. My work and upcoming projects revolve around creating intelligent systems that reduce friction and free up time — so people can focus on more meaningful, creative, or complex work instead of repetitive routines.

Some of my recent projects include developing **smart heat pump controls**, and contributing to research on **Learning to Optimize**, which was the focus of my Bachelor’s thesis. I enjoy diving deep into both applied and theoretical aspects of AI — and I'm always curious about how elegant math can power real-world efficiency.

Outside of academics and projects, I’m into music and movement — I play the **piano**, enjoy **bouldering**, and practice **karate**. These interests help me stay balanced, creative, and focused in and out of work.
