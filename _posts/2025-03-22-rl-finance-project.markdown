Welcome to the first post of my **Reinforcement Learning in Finance** project! 👋

This blog will serve as my public notebook — a place to document ideas, experiments, results, mistakes, breakthroughs, and everything in between as I try to answer this core question:

> *Can reinforcement learning agents learn to make intelligent decisions in dynamic, noisy financial markets?*

### 💡 Why RL in Finance?

Markets are complex, uncertain, and ever-changing — which makes them a fascinating environment for reinforcement learning. The idea of training agents that can **learn to trade**, **adapt to new patterns**, or even **discover strategies** is both exciting and challenging.

That said, it's also messy, data-hungry, and filled with edge cases. Which is exactly why I'm documenting everything here.

### 🔬 What I’m Planning To Explore

Some of the topics I’ll cover along the way:

- ✅ Environment design for market simulation
- ✅ Reward shaping and agent feedback
- ✅ Deep RL algorithms (PPO, DQN, A2C, etc.)
- ✅ Portfolio-level decision making
- ✅ Common pitfalls (overfitting, hindsight bias)
- ✅ Evaluation metrics that actually mean something

---

### 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, OpenAI Gym, stable-baselines3
- **Data**: Yahoo Finance, simulated market data
- **Extras**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, wandb (maybe)

---

### ✍️ What to Expect Here

- Regular updates as I experiment and build
- Short blog-style deep dives into specific subtopics
- Honest reflections on what’s working (and what’s totally not)

This project is a learning journey — so the goal isn't just to make something that "works", but to **understand the process**, **ask the right questions**, and **sharpen my thinking** around AI in real-world settings.

Thanks for following along 🙌  
More updates soon. Next post: defining the environment and agent setup!
